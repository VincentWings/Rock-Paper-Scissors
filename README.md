[Play the Game](https://vincentwings.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)  

This project is a digital version of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game, where a player competes against the computer. The game follows the traditional rules:  
- **Rock beats scissors**  
- **Scissors beats paper**  
- **Paper beats rock**  

The goal is to be the first to reach a score of 10 points.  

## Features  

- **Player vs. Computer**: The user selects rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer makes a random choice.  
- **Score Tracking**: Displays and updates both the player's and computer's scores in real-time.  
- **Game End & Winner Declaration**: The game continues until one player reaches a score of 10, at which point a winner is declared.  
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Shows whether the player won or lost each round with visual indicators.  

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML5**: Page structure and layout.  
- **CSS3**: Styling and visual effects.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Implements game logic, including event listeners, score tracking, and random choice generation.  

## How It Works  

1. The game initializes the player's and computer's scores at **0** and sets the maximum score to **10**.  
2. DOM elements are selected for displaying the scores, result titles, and images representing player and computer choices.  
3. The game defines separate functions for:  
   - Randomly generating the computerâ€™s choice.  
   - Determining the result based on player and computer selections.  
   - Updating scores and the result display after each round.  
4. Event listeners are attached to buttons for **rock**, **paper**, and **scissors**, triggering the game logic upon each selection.  
5. The game continues until one player reaches the maximum score, at which point the winner is declared.  

## Skills Demonstrated  

- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Efficient handling of user input and DOM manipulation.  
- **Game Logic**: Implementing the rules and conditions for a fully functional game.  
- **User Interface Feedback**: Providing real-time visual feedback for each game round.  

This project showcases a fun and interactive game built entirely with JavaScript, enhancing user experience through smooth gameplay and visual updates. ðŸŽ®
